This is a tiny package that allows data sets to be documented in the same manner
as functions/variables.

* Usage

Add =DataToolkitDocumenter= along with =Documenter= when generating the
documentation, and ensure that any data collection(s) you want to document are
loaded.

In the documentation source files themselves, use =@datasets= in the same manner
as =@docs= to document some data sets by their identifier, e.g.

#+begin_src md
```@datasets
iris
[other identifiers...]
```
#+end_src

For documenting an entire data collection with ease, one can use =@autodatasets=.
With no content it will document the first collection on the stack, but specific
collections can be documented by setting a =Collections= value, like so:

#+begin_src md
```@autodatasets
Collections = [nothing, "foo", "bar", "ded0d04d-deda-4bd8-95cb-5b214a5e3ce6"]
```
#+end_src

The value of ~nothing~ is special, and refers to the top entry of the data
collection stack. Other collections can be referenced by name or UUID.
