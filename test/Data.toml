The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set
introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936
paper *\"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of
linear discriminant analysis\"*.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris
**setosa**, Iris **virginica** and Iris **versicolor**). Four features were
measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in
centimetres."""
